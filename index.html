       <p>Valentine’s Day is a holiday when lovers express their affection with greetings and gifts. It is also called 
        St. Valentine’s Day. The holiday has expanded to express affection between relatives and friends. holiday 
        (February 14) when lovers express their affection with greetings and gifts. Given their similarities, it has 
        been suggested that the holiday has origins in the Roman festival of Lupercalia, held in mid-February. The 
        festival, which celebrated the coming of spring, included fertility rites and the pairing off of women with men 
        by lottery. At the end of the 5th century, Pope Gelasius I forbid the celebration of Lupercalia and is sometimes
        attributed with replacing it with St. Valentine’s Day, but the true origin of the holiday is vague at best. 
        Valentine’s Day did not come to be celebrated as a day of romance until about the 14th century. </p>
